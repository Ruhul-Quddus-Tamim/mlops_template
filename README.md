# What is GitHub Codespaces and how can I use it in my teaching?

A codespace is aa development environment that's hosted in the cloud that you can configure.

## Why use it

- Repeatable environment offering a 0-config experience.
- Runs in the cloud.
- Can be configured and customized.
- Integrates with your repositories on GitHub.

## Customization

You can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by committing configuration files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.

You can configure things like:

- Extensions, you can specify what extensions should be preinstalled.
- Dotfiles and settings.

## For the Educator

For you as a teacher that means that you can create an environment, in the cloud, for your class that all students can use with 0 or next to 0 configuration regardless of what operating system they are using.

## Codespaces template

This repo is a GitHub template. The repo contains the following:

- `/api`, The sub directory `/api` contains a Web API built in [Fast API](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
- `README.md`. This file describes this repository and what's in it.
- `LICENSE`, this project is under MIT license. Learn more by reading the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in this repo.
- `CONTRIBUTE`, this project welcomes contributions. Read more in [CONTRIBUTE](./CONTRIBUTE)

## -1- Run it

To run what's in this repo, you need to first start a Codespaces instance.

1. Navigate to the main page of the newly created repository.
1. Under the repository name, use the  Code drop-down menu, and in the Codespaces tab, select "Create codespace on main".
   ![Create codespace](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-138303/images/help/codespaces/new-codespace-button.png)
Next, we will run our app.

## -2- Inspect your codespaces environment

What you have at this point is a pre configured environment where all the runtimes and libraries you need are already installed - a 0 config experience.

You also have a Jupyter Notebook that you can start using without any configuration.

> This environment will run the same regardless of whether your Students are on Windows, macOS or Linux.

1. Open up your Jupyter Notebook file *exercise.ipynb* and note how you can add code and run it.

## Challenges

You can change yor environment. Let us take you through two different challenges that you are likely to want to do.

### -1- Change Python runtime

Let's say you want to change what version of Python is installed. This is something you can control.

Open up *.devcontainer/devcontainer.json* and replace the following section:

```json
"VARIANT": "3.10-bullseye"
```

with the following instruction:

```json
"VARIANT": "3.8-bullseye"
```

this change will use Python 3.8 instead of 3.10.

### -2- Add extension

Your environment comes with preinstalled extensions. You can change which extensions your codespaces environment starts with, here's how:

1. Open file *.devcontainer/devcontainer.json* and locate the following JSON element **extensions**

   ```json
   "extensions": [
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-python.vscode-pylance"
   ]
   ```

1. Add the following entry to **extensions** list:

   ```json
   "codespaces-Contrib.codeswing"
   ```
  
   What you did above was to add the unique identifier of an extension of the [CodeSwing extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codespaces-Contrib.codeswing). This will let Codespaces know that this extension should be pre installed upon startup.

To find the unique identifier of an extension:

- Navigate to the extension's web page, like so <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codespaces-Contrib.codeswing>
- Locate the *Unique Identifier* field under **More info** section on your right side.
